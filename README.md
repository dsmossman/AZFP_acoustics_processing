## Installation Instructions

man hell if i know, just download the thing, it's all independent code files

## Processing Instructions

The order of operations goes like this:

1. raw_data_processing
2. acoustic_abundance_estimates
3. alignment_and_plotting

Each folder has its own readme which goes into further detail about each file. The "misc" folder contains various one-off files and a couple of necessary Matlab functions.
