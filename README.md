# messy_acoustics_processing

## Installation Instructions

Most of these files are standalone code files, with the exception of the Python files in raw_data_processing. In that folder you will find an environment file that should give you the necessary packages for a local conda environment.

## Processing Instructions

The order of operations goes like this:

1. raw_data_processing
2. acoustic_abundance_estimates
3. alignment_and_plotting

Each folder has its own readme which goes into further detail about each file.

The "misc" folder contains various one-off files unrelated to the processing pipeline and a couple of necessary Matlab functions.
