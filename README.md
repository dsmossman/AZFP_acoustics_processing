## Installation Instructions

man hell if i know, just download the thing, it's all independent code files

i lied actually there is a python environment that needs installing, i'll figure that out

## Processing Instructions

The order of operations goes like this:

1. raw_data_processing
2. acoustic_abundance_estimates
3. alignment_and_plotting

Each folder has its own readme which goes into further detail about each file.

The "misc" folder contains various one-off files unrelated to the processing pipeline and a couple of necessary Matlab functions.
